# Docker PHP
# Mesosphere DC/OS and Marathon compatible
This is a self build docker wit php and nginx based on Ubuntu. This docker do not contains any docker configuration such as (workdir, expose,...)  
Thus it's compatible with DC/OS and Mesos runtime.
It fixes also some problem encountred when we install php without a fontend user interaction.
You can find that in the starting script.
